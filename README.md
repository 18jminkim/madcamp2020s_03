madcamp 2020s week 3.

### Project members: 윤영준, 김재민
### Project Name: Just One Punch

### Summary:
#### - Game built with Unity game engine.
#### - An overly simple 1 vs. 1 combat game. Players can either rum, jump, or attack.
#### - Any valid 'hit' on a player instantly results in a K.O. The first player who scores three K.Os wins the match.
#### - There are three maps with three different gaming modes:
####  - Classic: a clean, fair, 1 vs. 1 fight.
####  - Dodgeball: can punch obstacles to throw at another player. Collision with a fast-travelling obstacle results in a K.O.
####  - Anonymous: two players have the exact same color, as well as ~8 bots moving in randomized directions. Try not expose yourself, while identifying your opponent!
